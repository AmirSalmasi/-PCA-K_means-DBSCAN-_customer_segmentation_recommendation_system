# -PCA-K_means-DBSCAN-_customer_segmentation_recommendation_system
In this project, based on the personal and purchase behavior data of store customers, we aim to segment customers into different clusters using clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and K-Means. This segmentation helps the store understand and optimize customer relationships, sales strategies, and marketing campaigns.
